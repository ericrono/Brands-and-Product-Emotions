    "In a world where technology startups are plentiful, consumer sentiment towards a brand can give us a lot of insights into their purchasing decisions, hence the financial performance of the company that makes them. Technology investment company WhiteOre have acquired our services to build them a predictive model that monitors recent tweets on technology products to help them make informed investment decisions. WhiteOre wants a generalizable model to gauge sentiment across different brands, to act as a filtering system to help decide which brands to investigate further for possible investment. WhiteOre only cares about whether people have positive emotions towards the brand because people buy things they like."

    "The dataset comes from CrowdFlower via data.world. Human raters rated the sentiment in over 9,000 Tweets as positive, negative, or neither. The tweets included are sent out during the South by South West conference, mostly about Google and Apple products. The data was put together in 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweets are usually short and packed with emotions. They can capture consumer's real time response to a brand very well. South by Southwest showcases all the newest technology and allows consumers to compare the products of major tech companies side by side, which can reduce their biases to some degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "We engineered our target into two classes: tweets with positive sentiment and tweets without positive sentiment, which includes neutral, negative and indistinguishable sentiments. We only care about whether the tweet is positive because positive emotion drives sales, which can translate into return on investment.\n",

    "False positive in this case would mean our model predicts that a consumer has positive emotions towards a brand but they actually don't, leading to overvaluing of a potential investment opportunity and wasting human capital.\n",

    "We don't want to overvalue or undervalue a company, however, in the current market condition where labor cost and shortage is prominent, spending human resources to evaluate a company and finding out it's not worth investing in is more costly. Therefore, we care about maximizing accuracy as well as precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "We used nltk's TweetTokenizer and RegexpTokenizer to tokenize the tweets. We used count vectorizer and tfidf vectorizer to vectorize them. We limited our tfidf vectorizer features to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling techniques include naive bayes, logistic regression, catboost and neural network. We also ran decision trees and random forest in our draft notebooks in group member's individual folder.\n",

    "Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are able to achieve 71% accuracy on both training data and testing data on both our naive bayes and neural network models without overfitting. However, naive bayes requires significantly less computational power so we decide to use naive bayes as our final model."
